# FaceRecognition_WebApp
This app is made for a college project in Web Programming Course.

# Functionalities
The app offers the client registration and sign in. This app will have an input field where you enter a link of a photo from the internet. After you enter the link, you press the submit button and your photo will be loaded below the input field and if there is a face in the photo, it will be recognized and marked with a rectangle. We will use the Clarifai API for face recognition and marking. We will also use React.js with PostgreSQL database. All of our code will be written in Visual Studio Code IDE.
